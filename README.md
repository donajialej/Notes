# README
Writing journal for my postdoc at UNott

A bit of an index: _(need to find a way to do it auto)_
- papers_notes_2021.md will have notes for especific papers
- journal_2021 will mostly work as a journal with notes from normal working days.
- Biolgy_dictionary will have notes on bio words I learned.
- ToDo is selfexplatory
- from_myokit_tutorial folder: it will include a first try to single channel simulations
