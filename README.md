# Notes
Writing journal for my postdoc at UNott

A bit of an index: _(need to find a way to do it auto)_
- papers_notes_2021.md will have notes for especific papers
- journal_2021 will mostly work as a journal with notes from normal working days.


### Markdown
Text attributes _italic_, **bold**, `monospace`. 

Strikethrough: ~~strikethrough~~
