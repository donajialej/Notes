Data from Kylie's sine wave paper extracted from .csv files at Michale's four ways of fitting github.
Text file names: "Kylie" + protocol number (ex "PR1") + cells included in file (ex "cell123").

Protocol dictionary:

PR1 = activation kinetic1
PR2 = activation kinetic2
PR3 = steady activation
PR4 = inactivation
PR5 = deactivation
PR6 = action potential
PR7 = sine wave

Cell dictionary:

cell 1 = 16713003
cell 2 = 16715049
cell 3 = 16708016
cell 4 = 16708060
cell 5 = 16713110
cell 6 = 16708118
cell 7 = 16704007
cell 8 = 16704047
cell 9 = 16707014


Notes:
- For PR1, only 9 cells.
- For PR1 and PR2, cells 7 and 8 have different lengths and voltages than the others.
- For PR6, cell 10 has different voltage than the others
- For PR7, cell 10 has different voltage than the others, but the difference is of order e-09
- PR3 file is 114MB, zipped to upload (unzipped file stored locally)
- PR5 file is 180MB, zipped to upload (unzipped file stored locally)
